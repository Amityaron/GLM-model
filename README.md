# Generalized Linear Model  <br />
The objective of this project was to construct a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) that establishes a connection between infant mortality and low birth-weight babies. <br />

To initiate the project, we began by reading the file "birthwt.desc.pdf" to gain insights into the data on birth weights. Subsequently, we opened the file "birthwt.data.139.txt," which contained the actual data. <br />

For a comprehensive data analysis, we referred to the file "GLM Birth Weights -pre analysis.edited.pdf," which provided detailed information about the data analysis process. <br />

Throughout the project, the Probit regression link from the following source was utilized: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probit_model. <br />

In pursuit of our objectives, we employed the following methodologies: <br />

1. Matrix correlation <br />
2. Automatic Variable Selection Algorithms based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) <br />

3. Leverage analysis <br />
4. Cook's distance examination <br />
5. Exploration of interactions among explanatory variables. <br />

By implementing these methodologies, we aimed to establish a robust GLM model that sheds light on the relationship between infant mortality and low birth-weight babies. <br />
