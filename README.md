# Generalized Linear Model  <br />
The goal of the project was to a build GLM <br />
model that connects Infant mortality and low <br />
birth-weight babies.<br />
First read the file birthwt.desc.pdf and Open the file birthwt.data.139.txt.<br />
The file birthwt.desc.pdf give Description of data on birth weights.<br />
Secend Open the GLM Birth Weights -pre analysis.edited.pdf to see the Data Analysis.<br />
I use here the Probit regression link below : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probit_model <br />
Doring the project I use the  Methodologies: <br />
1.Matrix correlation <br />
2.Automatic Variable Selection Algorithms AIC <br />
3.Leverage <br />
4.Cook distance <br />
5.Interactions of Explanatory Variables.
